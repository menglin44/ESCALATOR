This is a pipeline for harmonizing and calculating polygenic scores on a genetic dataset. 

* The original pipeline, specifically developed and to run on Eureka cloud platform for Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine, is archived under the subfolder [eureka_cloud_version](eureka_cloud_version)

* For general use on extensive platforms, we provide a containerized copy. Due to the file size of the container image, we do not host the image in this github, instead we offer

   - (1) the scripts and def file to build your container, with [instructions](https://github.com/MatthewFisher126/ESCALATOR?tab=readme-ov-file#using-the-container) from Matthew Fisher (matthew.j.fisher@cuanschutz.edu),

   - (2) or as an alternate, directly download the ready-to-use container image momentarily hosted [here](https://olucdenver-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/meng_lin_cuanschutz_edu/EUhdyKWBfIZPnTSixfNsMLMB71Z-moUIn01oz158jNKWkw).
 
(Please refer to the [separate folk](https://github.com/MatthewFisher126/ESCALATOR) for Matt's explanations and changes of generalized scripts and instructions of building the container)


### Overview

The pipeline takes care of build lifting, strand flipping, allele code mismatching etc. between external weights of PRS and the target genetic data, and calculation of final scores.

### Usage

In light of using the containerized version, ESCALATOR can be run as 

```bash
singularity exec escalator-v1.sif masterPRS_format_v2_freeze3.sh [reformatting script designed (1, 2, 3, or F)] \
[input directory (where weight file is)] \
[weight input filename] \
[output directory] \
[trait name (e.g. trait_PGSxxx)] \
[pfile directory] \
[pfile infix name - ex: chr22_freeze3_dosages_PAIR.pgen = freeze3_dosages_PAIR] \
[whether to remove variants with ambiguous codes - T or F]
```

Detailed explanations for logistics, along with usage examples, are described in the [vignette](escalator_container/ESCALATOR_container_readme.pdf) .
