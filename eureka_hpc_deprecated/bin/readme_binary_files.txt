The pipeline needs binary files (e.g. plink2, liftover). The relevant files are included in the compressed folder.

The files are called in the master script (including the step to copy them from the gs bucket directories on Eureka).

The files from the compressed folder already exist under gs://hdchpcprodtis1-staging/mlin/bin/
